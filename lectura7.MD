This paper presents a revision of state-of-the-art publications on interactive recommender systems. The authors begin with an introduction to recommender systems highlighting current limitations. In section 2 they describe recommender algorithms and visualization techniques. Then, in section 3, they present a new framework that ties together user data, context data, recommender engine, medium, and recommendations. In the next 3 sections, they provide the survey results.

This paper provides multiple images that show most of the recommender systems reviewed. In my opinion, a vast amount of the visualizations featured are not easy to understand for a non-expert user. This issue constitutes a significant problem because the objective of such systems is to allow the user to understand certain aspects of the system. Up until the evaluation section this issue was not addressed. In the evaluation section, the authors say that the visualizations presented do improve efficiency to complete tasks except for TalkExplorer that is difficult to use by non-technical users. I think that it is important to be aware of difficulties that the user may encounter when using interactive recommenders since it is easy for us (technical users) to forget the complexity of some tasks for non-technical users.

While reading the paper I developed a simple interaction that covers justification, controllability, diversity, and context. Similar to one of the reviewed papers, one could present to the user a scatter plot of items that also contains a point representing the user in the item space. The user can then move its corresponding point towards items that she likes. So far this approach takes into account controllability and justification. To add diversity and context, we can add more points to represent a user, this idea comes from thinking that a single person could have different profiles. With this, we allow for diversity because the user can place the points as separated as she wants. The user can also encode her context by moving the points to different zones depending on the context, for example when dealing with movies one could place a point close to movies that we prefer to watch alone or place it close to movies that we would want to watch with children.
