# Context-Aware Recommender System

This paper is an introduction to context-aware recommender systems. Such systems incorporate information about the context of user interactions. The authors begin by giving different general definitions of context and specifics for recommender systems. They describe observable, partially observable, and unobservable contexts as well as static and dynamic contexts. Then they discuss how to represent and model context, then they proceed by explaining paradigms for using contextual information. Finally, they end by describing use cases of such systems.

In this paper, the authors focus on representational context which is static. They also describe how conversational recommender systems have been an active area of research. I think although such systems can be interesting, their evaluation becomes super hard because of the need for user interactions. On the other hand, static contexts are easier to deal with but they might not yield as powerful recommenders as using dynamic contexts.

Almost all recommender systems use tuples of data containing the user, an item, and the rating provided by the user for that item. However, to account for context, the tuple is extended by inserting a new dimension for the context. It is known that recommender systems have usually sparse data. I think that by incorporating the context the data becomes even more sparse. The authors do not mention how this could impact the needs of data for training context-aware recommenders. Despite that, the techniques used are the same ones that were used before but adding one more step like filtering before or after a 2D system makes its recommendations. I think that these approaches make the process of adding context easier than expected.

Finally, I wanted to discuss an impression of mine related to these systems. In general machine learning methods are poorly related to software engineering until they are deployed in a production environment. Examples of this are recommender systems that only use user ratings of items. But there is an increase in the importance of the software when more complex user information is needed. Implicit feedback methods require that the measure of feedback is well collected and that depends on the software the user makes use of. In my opinion, the software is even more important in context-aware systems, where we need software that can accurately record the context of the user.
