This paper is a broad description of concepts and techniques used for evaluating recommender systems. It begins with an introduction to these topics, then it explains some experimental settings concepts and the different ways experiments can be done, next it explains methods for evaluating the results of the experiments and how to draw reliable conclusions from them. Finally, the authors end by describing the diverse properties such systems have and the trade-offs between them.

The first thing I want to say is that this work is very extensive and some sections are not exclusive to recommender systems which can be both a good or a bad thing depending on the reader's knowledge. Despite that, the authors at all times connect the topics with recommender systems and I think that is a very useful thing they do since it helps to picture the concepts applied.

In my opinion, some of the properties described are difficult to prioritize for certain types of recommenders. An example of this is the properties Novelty, Serendipity, and Diversity which are quite similar between them. For recommenders based on collaborative filtering, it could be hard to aim for these properties without losing substantial performance in properties like accuracy because there is no way to know if an item that is different from all the items a user has consumed will be valuable to the user. On the other hand, there are content filtering systems that can inherently capture similarities between items even if they are not consumed by the same users.

I also think the utility property is way too general and it involves all other properties. Any other property can be thought of as a measure of the utility of the systems, by improving them the utility of the system is also being improved. I do not think that making a separate definition for utility helps in any way.

Finally, I want to comment on a way I thought of implementing systems that take into account adaptivity. It is a very simple idea but just like for measuring rankings of recommendations one could penalize the value of a recommended item depending on the position in the ranking. We could prioritize the ratings over time, by applying similar rules in a way that the newest rankings have more weight into the final recommendation.
