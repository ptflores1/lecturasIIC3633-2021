This paper is a survey about Deep Learning (DL) techniques applied to Recommender Systems (RSs). The authors begin with an introduction describing the status of DL, the need for such a survey as well as their contributions. Then, they review general concepts about RSs, DL. They explain the properties of DL, why it should be used for RSs and the three most mentioned limitations. Finally, in section three, they review the application of different DL approaches to RSs.

First of all, I want to start by saying that, in my opinion, there is not much to critique this paper since it is a review over methods. I do, however, find it extremely helpful to have such work in hand. It allows us to have general knowledge of the topic and, to recognize major benefits and pitfalls in current publications.

In section 3.2 the authors describe Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) approaches. A couple of things caught my attention in this section. First, they show a work that replaced one-hot inputs with rows or columns of the interaction matrix. I find this idea to be super simple and smart, furthermore, I think it can be used not just in MLPs but in a wide variety of DL based methods. Secondly, they also show Wide & Deep Learning which consists of a network with sibling components, one being shallow and the other deep. With this combination of layers, they aim to capture memorization and generalization. For me, this approach resembles ResNet [1] where they use a residual connection to allow the net to "skip" a certain layer. Finally, they say that this network is trained on the concatenation of the data and some transformations of it which to me, is a little bit strange since one of the main benefits of using DL is exactly not needing to manually engineer features.
