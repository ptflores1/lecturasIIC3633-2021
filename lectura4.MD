# Content-Based Recommendation Systems
This paper discusses content-based recommender systems. It begins with an introduction describing what such systems are then discusses the representations of items and finally provides different methods of content-based recommender systems.

In my opinion, this paper is quite simple. The methods described are classical machine learning algorithms that are not specific to recommender systems. Since the authors look at the methods as text classifiers I think the sense of personalized recommendations is lost or at least hidden. For example, in the Nearest Neighbors section, they only describe how to classify a document using previous documents. It is not clear how we can recommend a user using this method. Should we have one classifier for each user?.  Maybe we can compute a vector to represent the user in the same document vector space. A similar thing happens for the rest of the methods.

Given that the publication of this work was in 2007, there is a big missing topic which is the use of deep learning models. Recently there has been a lot of work in natural language models using deep learning like Google's BERT model[1]. Such powerful models can be helpful to compute much richer representations of documents that could lead to improved recommendation performance.
